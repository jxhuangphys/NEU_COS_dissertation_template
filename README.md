# NEU_COS_dissertation_template

The Ph.D. Dissertation LaTeX Template for **College of Science** students at **Northeastern University**.

It is time-consuming to create a LaTeX template from scratch. We have gone through the process and hope to save our fellow researchers some time. So please feel free to directly use this templete in your dissertation to accelerate your writing. Mention in the acknowledgments section is optional but appreciated.

The <Official-Sample-Pages-Dissertation-and-Thesis-COS.pdf> indicates the official format requirements, which have been reproduced by the <main.tex>.
