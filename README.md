# NEU_COS_dissertation_template

The Ph.D. Dissertation LaTeX Template for **College of Science** students at **Northeastern University**.

As of December 2023, to the best of our knowledge, there isn't a publicly available NEU-COS dissertation LaTeX template (unlike NEU-COE, which has an official one with differing format requirements). Recognizing the significant time investment required to create a LaTeX template from scratch, we have developed and shared a ready-to-use template in this repository to aid our fellow researchers.

This template aligns with the official format requirements as outlined in the Official-Sample-Pages-Dissertation-and-Thesis-COS.pdf. These guidelines have been carefully replicated in our 'main.pdf' file, generated from 'main.tex.'

While not obligatory, a mention in your acknowledgment section would be appreciated to increase awareness of this resource among the student community. Alternatively, sharing this link with your peers would also contribute to its wider usage and benefit.

If the COS updates its format requirements in the future, please let us know, and we will update the template accordingly.
